"Pat's Salmon Cookies-Day 1 Lab Assignment"

To Do: 
1. New repository properly set up with a license and README, and cloned to local machine. 
2. Working on a non-master branch, with regular commit history. 
2. Good use of Object Literals (no constructors allowed today); one for each store model; properties/values and methods are correctly constructed and given meaningful names.
3. Index/external page meets requirements of the problem domain. 
4. Stores are correctly rendering as lists to the sales/internal page

User Stories (MVP):
* As a user, I want a webpage that displays individual store data for my Salmon Cookie Shops, so that I can be informed about how to run my business
* As a developer, I want to represent the store data in a list format on the webpage, so my client can view the information
* As a developer, I want to use object-oriented programming to build this site, so that the site will be more effective and the code will be easier to read and understand
