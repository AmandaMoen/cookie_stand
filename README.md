"Pat's Salmon Cookies-Day 1 Lab Assignment"

To Do: 
1. New repository properly set up with a license and README, and cloned to local machine. 
2. Working on a non-master branch, with regular commit history. 
2. Good use of Object Literals (no constructors allowed today); one for each store model; properties/values and methods are correctly constructed and given meaningful names.
3. Index/external page meets requirements of the problem domain. 
4. Stores are correctly rendering as lists to the sales/internal page

User Stories (MVP):
* As a user, I want a webpage that displays individual store data for my Salmon Cookie Shops, so that I can be informed about how to run my business
* As a developer, I want to represent the store data in a list format on the webpage, so my client can view the information
* As a developer, I want to use object-oriented programming to build this site, so that the site will be more effective and the code will be easier to read and understand


"Pat's Salmon Cookies-Day 2 Lab Assignment"

To Do: 
1. Implement a Constructor Function. 
2. Replace the lists with a table.
// The top row needs to autopopulate with hours
// Rows 2-7 needs to populate with the data from the CookieStand data
// We want the final row to populate the sum of the hourly totals for all the stores

// We want column 1 to be populated with the location names.
// we want columns 2-15 to populate with the number of cookies sold for each hour.
// We want column 16 (the final column) to populate the sum total cookies for the
// day for each location. sum (c2-c15)

User Stories (MVP):
* As a developer, I want to implement a constructor function, so that I can reuse code and eliminate much of the duplication in my JavaScript
* As a user, I want cookie sales data represented in tables rather than lists

"Pat's Salmon Cookies-Day 3 Lab Assignment"

User Stories (MVP):
* Today you will be adding a form to your existing cookie stand project so that you can add new locations to the table by simply inputting their information with the form.

"Pat's Salmon Cookies-Day 4 Lab Assignment"

To Do:
1. Continue working on the functionality of your sales.html page if you do not have it working 100% yet, including the row of totals across the bottom.
2. Continue with your own design that you've started on index.html.
3. For your design, Pat INSISTS that you must use all of the images in the adjacent asset directory. Every. Single. One.
4. Your public-facing page mockup in index.html should have all of the things you'd expect such a page to have for such a business: locations with addresses, hours open, contact information, and so on. Just make up versions of these things since this is not a real business, of course.
5. You can also mock up references to (either links or little sections on the index page) for things like About Us (company history and mission), Merchandise (sales of t-shirts, mugs, stickers, etc.), links to salmon events like the Salmon Days in Issaquah, etc.
6. Apply a similar style to the sales.html page.

"Pat's Salmon Cookies-Day 5 Lab Assignment"
The MVP version of the project involves completion of the functionality and styling of the index.html and data.html pages.

One more thing: Use a gh-pages branch to deploy it!
